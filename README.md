This repo includes code that was written in Tensorflow to create a neural network that predicts various characteristics of probability distribution functions. There are three different types of neural networks included in this project. The first is the Mean and Standard Deviation Networks. This network takes in a number of disctete x values as input and randomly generates discrete x values and mean and sigma labels to train the network. This repo consists of one file that tests parameters in attempts to find the best combination of network parameters to minimize the error. The second mean and standard deviation file looks at the mean and standard deviation errors individually and separate from one another to see if the network is learning one better than the other. The second type of neural network enclosed in this repo is the polynomial neural network. This network takes in a number of moments and number of coefficients as inputs and randomly generates training and testing data to predict coefficients of a polynomial equation. The third type is the generalized normal neural network that expands upon the Gaussian mean and standard devation model. In parallel with the Gaussian, there is a file that tests the parameters and a file that looks at each of the labels individually and separately. There is also a general network that can train anything based on the passed in dataset
